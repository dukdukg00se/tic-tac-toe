# tic-tac-toe

This repo was created as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum where the goal is to make a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the browser. As part of this project, I try to organize my code in a way where I have as little global code as possible and to try to use modules or factory functions as often as I can.
